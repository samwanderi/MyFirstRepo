My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
Until a few days ago my dream was to study in Macalester and truth be told I was seeing myself in St. Paul where the university is located. I was rejected 
and for a moment I called myself delusional but it wasn't delusion, it was hope. I still hope to attain a scholarship where the Swaniker mentors will guide me.
A year from now I NEED to be studying abroad and eating healthy and working on myself as person both physically and mentally. I would love to be one of the top students in the university 
that I would selected.
